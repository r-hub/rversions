# rversions (development version)

# rversions 3.0.0

rversions now uses R-hub's [R version API](https://api.r-hub.io/rversions).
The `r_oldrel()`, `r_release()`, `r_release_macos()`, `r_release_tarball()`,
and `r_release_win()` functions are now superseded by the new `resolve()`
function, see their manual pages.

* New function `resolve()` to resolve an R version specification.

* New function `available()` to list available R builds for a platform.

* New function `linux_distros()` to list Linux distributions supported
  by Posit or R-hub.

* New function `rtools_versions()` to list Rtools versions.

* New utility function `current_r_platform()` to look up the current
  platform, including the distribution and release on Linux.

No user visible changes.

# rversions 2.1.0

* `r_release_macos()` is now correct again for R 4.1.0.

# rversions 2.0.2

* `r_release_tarball()` now has the correct URL for R 4.x.x.

# rversions 2.0.1

* The date columns of all data.frames is now POSIXt, POSIXct, not POSIXlt, so you can convert the data.frames with `tibble::as_tibble()` directly (#20, @espinielli).

# rversions 2.0.0

## Breaking change

* `r_versions()` and all other functions now parse the date, so the date
  column is a POSIXt, not a character (#13).

# rversions 1.1.0

* All function outputs now also have a column with version nickname(s).

* R versions are now cached within each R session (@richfitz, #6).

# rversions 1.0.3

* Use `xml2::xml_find_first` instead of deprecated `xml2::xml_find_one`
  (Thanks to @jimhester)

# rversions 1.0.2

* Explicit import from base packages

# rversions 1.0.1

* Rewritten using `xml2` and `curl` instead of `XML` and `RCurl`
  (Thanks to @jeroenooms)
