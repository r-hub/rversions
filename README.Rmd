The R version numbers and dates are extracted from the
main R SVN repository at https://svn.r-project.org/R/.

`rversions` is in particular useful for determining at any given moment what versions "R-release" and "R-oldrel" refer to. This is useful for e.g. [R-hub](https://docs.r-hub.io/).

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rversions")
```

## Usage

### R-release and R-oldrel

```{r}
library(rversions)
r_release()
r_oldrel()
```

### All R versions and release dates

```{r}
r_versions()
```
